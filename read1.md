# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
Gists
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension

# GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.

Code Sample:
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
