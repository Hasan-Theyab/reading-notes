Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators:

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
JavaScript has the following expression categories:

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159.     (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
- String: evaluates to a character string, for example,       "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
- Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves        logical operators.)
- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general             expressions in JavaScript.
- Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the             destination of an assignment.

## For statement

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression];[incrementExpression]) 
  statement

## while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement
