# Error Handling & Debugging in JS

- *If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.*


- *Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.*



- *The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.*


- *JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.*


- *If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.*



# DEBUGGING TIPS

Here are a selection of practical tips that you can try to use when debugging your scripts.

## ANOTHER BROWSER

Some problems are browserspecific. Try the code in another browser to see which ones are causing a problem.

## ADD NUMBERS

Write numbers to the console so you can see which the items get logged. It shows how far your code runs before errors stop it.

## STRIP IT BACK

Remove parts of code, and strip it down to the minimum you need. You can do this either by removing the code altogether, or by just commenting it out using multi-line comments: /* Anything between these characters is a cofllllent */


## EXPLAINING THE CODE

Programmers often report finding a solution to a problem while explaining the code to someone else.

## SEARCH

Stack Overflow is a Q+A site for programmers. Or use a traditional search engine such as Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.

## CODE PLAYGROUNDS

If you want to ask about problematic code on a forum, in addition to pasting the code into a post, you could add it to a code playground site (such as JSBin.com, JSFiddle. com, or Dabbl et. corn) and then post a link to it from the forum. (Other popular playgrounds include CSSDeck. com and Code Pen. com - but these sites place more emphasis on showand tell.)


## VALIDATION TOOLS

There are a number of on line validation tools that can help you try to find errors in your code:

*JAVASCRIPT*
*http://www.jslint.com*
*http://www.jshint .com*

*JSON*
*http:// www.jsonlint.com*

*JQUERY*
There is a jQuery debugger
plugin available for Chrome
which can be found in the
Chrome web store.
