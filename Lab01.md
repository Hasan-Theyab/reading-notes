# Growth Mindset
Learning Markdown

A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a *love of learning*.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

**3 reminders** to Myself of how to keep Myself in a growth mindset:
1. Challenges
2. Obstacles
3. Effort

Here is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset) to a page of growth mindset on Wikipedia.
